## 🎯 Key Demo Talking Points

**Opening:**
> "This is a Digital Twin system, not just AI. It combines Machine Learning with Physics-Informed reasoning for fully explainable leak detection."

**During Demo:**
- Show slider movement → Pipes change color
- Select different pipes → Inspection panel updates
- Point out calibration → "The DT is learning!"
- Explain multi-signal → "Both ML and Physics must agree"

**Closing:**
> "The Digital Twin validates predictions against physical laws, learns from observations, and provides transparent reasoning—making it practical for real-world deployment."
